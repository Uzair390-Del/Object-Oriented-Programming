# **1. Introduction to Structures**  

### **What is a Structure?**  
A **structure** (`struct`) is a user-defined data type in C++ that **groups multiple variables** (of different types) into a single unit.  

**Why Use Structures?**  
- Helps in **organizing related data** efficiently.  
- Enables **better readability** and maintainability.  
- Useful for handling **complex data** (e.g., student records, employee details).  

### **Declaring a Structure**  
A structure is defined using the `struct` keyword, followed by its **name** and **members**.

```cpp
struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float gpa;
};
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Student` is the **structure name**.  
- `name`, `age`, and `gpa` are **data members**.  

---  

### **Creating and Accessing Structure Variables**  

Once a structure is defined, we can create **structure variables (objects)** and access its members using the **dot (`.`) operator**.

#### **Example 1: Basic Structure Usage**  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

int main() {
    Student s1;  // Creating a structure variable

    // Assigning values
    s1.name = "Alice";
    s1.age = 20;
    s1.gpa = 3.9;

    // Displaying values
    cout << "Student Name: " << s1.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << s1.age << endl;
    cout << "GPA: " << s1.gpa << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **ðŸ”Ž Step-by-Step Dry Run**  

| **Step** | **Statement Executed** | **Memory State** |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | `Student s1;` | `s1` is created |
| 2 | `s1.name = "Alice";` | `s1.name = "Alice"` |
| 3 | `s1.age = 20;` | `s1.age = 20` |
| 4 | `s1.gpa = 3.9;` | `s1.gpa = 3.9` |
| 5 | `cout` statements | Output displayed |

# **2. Pointers and Structures**  
### **What are Pointers to Structures?**  
A **pointer** is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. When working with structures, **pointers help in accessing and modifying structure members efficiently** without needing to copy entire structures. This is particularly useful for large structures, as passing them by pointer avoids unnecessary memory usage.  

**Advantages of Using Pointers with Structures:**  
- Efficient memory usage, as only the address is passed instead of the entire structure.  
- Faster data access and modification.  
- Used in dynamic memory allocation, allowing structures to be created at runtime. 

### **Example 2: Pointer to Structure**  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

int main() {
    Student s1 = {"Bob", 21, 3.8};
    Student* ptr = &s1;  // Pointer to structure

    // Accessing structure members using pointer
    cout << "Using Pointer:" << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << ptr->name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << ptr->age << endl;
    cout << "GPA: " << ptr->gpa << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **ðŸ”Ž Step-by-Step Dry Run**  

| **Step** | **Statement Executed** | **Memory State** |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | `Student s1 = {"Bob", 21, 3.8};` | `s1` is created |
| 2 | `Student* ptr = &s1;` | `ptr` stores `s1`'s address |
| 3 | `cout << ptr->name;` | "Bob" is printed |
| 4 | `cout << ptr->age;` | `21` is printed |
| 5 | `cout << ptr->gpa;` | `3.8` is printed |

# **3. Dynamic Memory Allocation for Structures**  
### **Why Use Dynamic Allocation for Structures?**  
Dynamic memory allocation allows structures to be created at **runtime** using the `new` keyword. This is useful when the number of structure instances is unknown at compile time. Memory allocated dynamically must be **deallocated** using the `delete` keyword to prevent memory leaks.  

**Advantages of Dynamic Structures:**  
- Memory is allocated only when needed, reducing wastage.  
- Useful for handling variable-sized data structures (e.g., dynamic arrays of structures).  
- Enables more flexible and scalable programs. 

### **Example 3: Creating Structure Dynamically**  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

int main() {
    Student* ptr = new Student;  // Allocating memory dynamically

    // Assigning values using pointer
    ptr->name = "David";
    ptr->age = 22;
    ptr->gpa = 3.7;

    // Displaying values
    cout << "Dynamically Allocated Student Details:" << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << ptr->name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << ptr->age << endl;
    cout << "GPA: " << ptr->gpa << endl;

    delete ptr;  // Free memory
    return 0;
}
```

### **ðŸ”Ž Step-by-Step Dry Run**  

| **Step** | **Statement Executed** | **Memory State** |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | `ptr = new Student;` | Memory allocated for `ptr` |
| 2 | `ptr->name = "David";` | `ptr->name = "David"` |
| 3 | `ptr->age = 22;` | `ptr->age = 22` |
| 4 | `ptr->gpa = 3.7;` | `ptr->gpa = 3.7` |
| 5 | `delete ptr;` | Memory freed |

# Passing Structures to Functions Using Pointers

## Why Pass by Pointer?
âœ” **Efficient** (avoids copying large structures).
âœ” Allows **direct modification** of structure members inside a function.

### Example: Function Modifying Structure
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

void updateStudent(Student* s) {
    s->age += 1;
    s->gpa += 0.1;
}

int main() {
    Student s1 = {"Emma", 19, 3.5};

    cout << "Before Update: Age = " << s1.age << ", GPA = " << s1.gpa << endl;
    updateStudent(&s1);
    cout << "After Update: Age = " << s1.age << ", GPA = " << s1.gpa << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

# Array of Structures Using Pointers

## Why Use an Array of Structures?
âœ” **Efficiently store and manage multiple records**.
âœ” Allows handling of **large datasets dynamically**.

### Example: Dynamically Allocated Array of Structures
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

int main() {
    int n = 2;
    Student* students = new Student[n];

    students[0] = {"Mike", 20, 3.2};
    students[1] = {"Sarah", 21, 3.9};

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << "Student " << i + 1 << ": " << students[i].name 
             << ", Age: " << students[i].age 
             << ", GPA: " << students[i].gpa << endl;
    }

    delete[] students; // Free memory
    return 0;
}
```
