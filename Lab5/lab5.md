# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab Tasks

## **Lab Task 1: Library Management System (Basic Version)**
- Create a `Book` class with data members: `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, and `price`.
- Implement constructors (default, parameterized, copy).
- Implement a destructor to print when a book object is destroyed.
- Write member functions to:
  - Display book details.
  - Update the book price.
- Create objects and test all functionalities.

## **Lab Task 2: Student Record System**
- Create a `Student` class with data members: `name`, `rollNumber`, `CGPA`.
- Implement constructors and destructors.
- Implement member functions to:
  - Assign values using constructors.
  - Display student details.
  - Copy details from one object to another (using copy constructor).

## **Lab Task 3: Bank Account Simulation**
- Create a `BankAccount` class with:
  - Data members: `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, `balance`.
  - Constructor to initialize the account.
  - Member functions:
    - Deposit amount.

- Implement constructors and a destructor.
- Implement functions to:
  - Display car details.
  - Update the price of a car.
- Demonstrate by creating multiple `Car` objects.
