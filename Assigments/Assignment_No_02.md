# Object-Oriented Programming in C++ — Lab Assignment

## Assignment No 2:

**Difference between Stack Memory and Heap Memory**

## Submission Type:

Written Assignment (Handwritten)

## Deadline:

**Next Class**

---

## Objective:

To understand and clearly explain the **differences between stack memory and heap memory** in C++ programming, including usage, behavior, advantages, limitations, and examples.

---

## Instructions for Students:

Prepare a **written assignment** covering the following points. Use **diagrams**, **code snippets**, and **real-life analogies** wherever necessary to make your explanation clear and easy to understand.

---

## Assignment Content Structure:

### 1. Introduction

* What is memory in programming?
* Why do we need to manage memory in C++?

### 2. Stack Memory

* What is stack memory?
* Characteristics of stack memory
* How variables are stored in stack
* Lifetime and scope of stack variables
* Example code using stack memory (e.g., normal variable declaration or function call)

### 3. Heap Memory

* What is heap memory?
* Characteristics of heap memory
* How variables are allocated in heap (using `new`)
* Memory management and `delete` keyword
* Lifetime and scope of heap variables
* Example code using heap memory

### 4. Key Differences Table

Prepare a comparison table for stack and heap memory with the following headings:

| Feature                           | Stack Memory | Heap Memory |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Memory allocation method          |              |             |
| Speed                             |              |             |
| Lifetime of variables             |              |             |
| Need for manual memory management |              |             |
| Size limit                        |              |             |
| Use case examples                 |              |             |

### 5. Diagrams

* Draw a memory layout diagram showing stack and heap regions
* Show how memory is allocated and deallocated in both regions

### 6. Advantages and Disadvantages

* Pros and cons of using stack memory
* Pros and cons of using heap memory

### 7. Real-Life Analogy (Optional but encouraged)

* Use a simple analogy like: “Stack is like a pile of plates; heap is like a bookshelf where you can put and remove books anywhere.”

### 8. Conclusion

* Summary of what you learned
* When to prefer stack over heap and vice versa

## Additional Notes:

* You may write this assignment by hand.
* Ensure you write in **your own words**.
* Use **simple language** and be clear in explanations.
