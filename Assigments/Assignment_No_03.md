## 📚 Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to ensure students:

- Understand the concepts of static data and member functions, inline functions, and friend functions.  
- Can differentiate between normal and special function types in C++.  
- Gain hands-on experience by implementing all three features in a well-structured C++ program.  
- Are able to defend and explain their code in a viva voce session.

## 🧠 What to Include in the Report

### Theory Section (Each topic should be 1–2 pages):

#### Static Data Members and Static Member Functions
- What are they?  
- Syntax and characteristics  
- Use cases and benefits  

#### Friend Functions
- What is a friend function?  
- How and why to use it?  
- Security and encapsulation concerns  

### Code Explanation Section
- Explain the logic behind your implementation.  
- Why did you use a particular approach?  
- Line-by-line or block-by-block explanation of the code.  

### Screenshots and Output
- Include screenshots of successful code compilation and output for clarity.

## 💻 Implementation Requirements

Write a C++ program that meets the following criteria:

- Demonstrates the use of **static data members and static member functions** (e.g., a counter to count objects created).  
- Includes at least one **friend function** accessing private data of two different classes.  

> 💡 Make sure the program is clean, well-commented, and properly indented.

## 🎤 Viva Voce Guidelines

Each student must:

- Explain their own code in detail.  
- Justify the use of static, inline, and friend functions in their code.  
- Answer conceptual questions related to the implementation.  
- Demonstrate that they understand both **syntax** and **semantics** of what they wrote.
